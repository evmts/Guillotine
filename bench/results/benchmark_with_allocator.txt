=== SUMMARY ===
Overall performance improvements with EvmMemoryAllocator:
- Average improvement across hardfork benchmarks: ~20.8% faster
- Stack operations show significant improvements: 27-50% faster
- Only one minor regression: Hardfork Flag Checks (9.8% slower)

The arena allocator wrapper provides:
1. Better memory locality through page-aligned allocations
2. Reduced allocation overhead
3. More efficient memory access patterns
4. Significant performance gains in stack operations
