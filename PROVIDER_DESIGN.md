## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Primitives
1. Basic types (Address, Hash, U256)
2. Transaction types
3. ABI encoding/decoding
4. Basic hashing functions

### Phase 2: Basic Provider
1. HTTP transport
2. Basic RPC methods (eth_call, eth_sendTransaction)
3. Block and transaction queries
4. Error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. WebSocket support
2. Event watching
3. Contract interactions
4. ENS support

### Phase 4: L2 & Account Abstraction
1. L2-specific features
2. Smart accounts
3. Advanced gas estimation
4. Multicall optimizations

## Design Principles

1. **Type Safety**: Leverage Zig's type system for compile-time guarantees
2. **Performance**: Minimize allocations, use stack allocation where possible
3. **Error Handling**: Use Zig's error unions for explicit error handling
4. **Modularity**: Keep primitives separate from provider logic
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with no abstractions
6. **Documentation**: Clear examples and API documentation

## API Examples

```zig
// Primitives usage
const addr = try Address.from_string("0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f8fA82");
const value = try parseEther("1.5");
const hash = try keccak256("hello world");

// Provider usage
var client = try Provider.init(allocator, .{
    .url = "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-API-KEY",
    .chain_id = 1,
});
defer client.deinit();

const balance = try client.getBalance(addr);
const block = try client.getBlock(.{ .latest = {} });

// Contract interaction
const contract = Contract.init(client, contract_address, abi);
const result = try contract.read("balanceOf", .{owner_address});
```

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize features based on use cases
2. Design detailed APIs for each module
3. Implement core primitives first
4. Build provider on top of primitives
5. Add comprehensive tests for each feature
6. Create comprehensive usage documentation
