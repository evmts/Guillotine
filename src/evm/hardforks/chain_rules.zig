/// ## Blob Transactions

///
/// ## Transient Storage

///
/// ## Note
/// This flag is reserved for future use and should remain

/// ## Purpose

///
/// ## Expected Benefits
/// - Witness sizes reduced from ~10MB to ~200KB
/// - Enables stateless clients
/// - Improved sync times and network efficiency
///
/// ## Status
/// Under active research and development. Will require extensive

///
/// ## Purpose
/// Major protocol upgrade adding privacy features and improving

///
/// ## Key Changes
/// - New opcodes: REVERT (0xFD), RETURNDATASIZE (0x3D), RETURNDATACOPY (0x3E)
/// - New opcode: STATICCALL (0xFA) for read-only calls
/// - Added precompiles for zkSNARK verification (alt_bn128)
/// - Difficulty bomb delay by 18 months
/// - Block reward reduced from 5 to 3 ETH
///
/// ## REVERT Impact
/// Allows contracts to revert with data, enabling better error

///
/// ## Privacy Features
/// zkSNARK precompiles enable privacy-preserving applications
/// like private transactions and scalability solutions.

/// EIP-2930 optional access lists activation (Berlin hardfork).

/// ## Purpose

/// allowing senders to pre-declare state they'll access.
///
/// ## Benefits
/// - Mitigates breaking changes from EIP-2929 gas increases
/// - Allows gas savings by pre-warming storage slots
/// - Provides predictable gas costs for complex interactions
///
/// ## Transaction Format
/// Type 1 transactions include an access list of:
/// - Addresses to be accessed
/// - Storage keys per address to be accessed
///
/// ## Gas Savings
/// Pre-declaring access saves ~2000 gas per address and
/// ~2000 gas per storage slot on first access.

/// EIP-3198 BASEFEE opcode activation (London hardfork).
///
/// ## Purpose
/// Provides smart contracts access to the current block's base fee,
/// enabling on-chain fee market awareness.
///
/// ## Opcode Details
/// - BASEFEE (0x48): Pushes current block's base fee onto stack
/// - Gas cost: 2 (same as other block context opcodes)
///
/// ## Use Cases
/// - Fee estimation within contracts
/// - Conditional execution based on network congestion
/// - MEV-aware contract patterns
/// - Gas price oracles
///
/// ## Complementary to EIP-1559
/// Essential for contracts to interact properly with the
/// new fee market mechanism.
is_eip3198: bool = true,

/// EIP-3651 warm COINBASE activation (Shanghai hardfork).
///
/// ## Purpose
/// Pre-warms the COINBASE address (block producer) to reduce gas costs
/// for common patterns, especially in MEV transactions.
///
/// ## Gas Impact
/// - Before: First COINBASE access costs 2600 gas (cold)
/// - After: COINBASE always costs 100 gas (warm)
///
/// ## MEV Considerations
/// Critical for MEV searchers and builders who frequently
/// interact with the block producer address for payments.
///
/// ## Implementation
/// The COINBASE address is added to the warm address set
/// at the beginning of transaction execution.
is_eip3651: bool = true,

/// EIP-3855 PUSH0 instruction activation (Shanghai hardfork).
///
/// ## Purpose
/// Introduces dedicated opcode for pushing zero onto the stack,
/// optimizing a very common pattern in smart contracts.
///
/// ## Opcode Details
/// - PUSH0 (0x5F): Pushes 0 onto the stack
/// - Gas cost: 2 (base opcode cost)
/// - Replaces: PUSH1 0x00 (costs 3 gas)
///
/// ## Benefits
/// - 33% gas reduction for pushing zero
/// - Smaller bytecode (1 byte vs 2 bytes)
/// - Cleaner assembly code
///
/// ## Usage Statistics
/// Analysis showed ~11% of all PUSH operations push zero,
/// making this a significant optimization.
is_eip3855: bool = true,

/// EIP-3860 initcode size limit activation (Shanghai hardfork).
///
/// ## Purpose
/// Introduces explicit limits and gas metering for contract creation
/// code to prevent DoS vectors and ensure predictable costs.
///
/// ## Key Limits
/// - Maximum initcode size: 49152 bytes (2x max contract size)
/// - Gas cost: 2 gas per 32-byte word of initcode
is_eip3860: bool = true,

/// EIP-4895: Beacon chain validator withdrawals

/// EIP-4844: Blob transactions for L2 data availability
///
/// ## L2 Impact
/// Dramatically reduces costs for rollups by providing
/// dedicated data availability layer.

/// EIP-1153 transient storage activation (Cancun hardfork).
///
/// ## Purpose
/// Introduces transaction-scoped storage that automatically clears
/// after execution, enabling efficient temporary data patterns.
///
/// ## New Opcodes
/// - TLOAD (0x5C): Load from transient storage
/// - TSTORE (0x5D): Store to transient storage
/// - Gas costs: 100 for TLOAD, 100 for TSTORE
///
/// ## Key Properties
/// - Cleared after each transaction (not persisted)
/// - Reverted on transaction failure
/// - Separate namespace from persistent storage
/// - More gas efficient than SSTORE/SLOAD for temporary data
///
/// ## Use Cases
/// - Reentrancy guards without storage slots
/// - Temporary computation results
/// - Cross-contract communication within transaction
is_eip1153: bool = true,

/// EIP-5656 MCOPY instruction activation (Cancun hardfork).
///
/// ## Purpose
/// Native memory copying instruction replacing inefficient
/// loop-based implementations in smart contracts.
///
/// ## Opcode Details
/// - MCOPY (0x5E): Copy memory regions
/// - Stack: [dest_offset, src_offset, length]
/// - Gas: 3 + 3 * ceil(length / 32) + memory expansion
///
/// ## Performance Impact
/// - ~10x faster than Solidity's loop-based copying
/// - Reduces bytecode size for memory operations
/// - Critical for data-heavy operations
///
/// ## Common Patterns
/// Optimizes array copying, string manipulation, and
/// data structure operations in smart contracts.
is_eip5656: bool = true,

/// EIP-3541 contract code prefix restriction (London hardfork).
///
/// ## Purpose
/// Reserves the 0xEF byte prefix for future EVM Object Format (EOF),
/// preventing deployment of contracts with this prefix.
///
/// ## Restrictions
/// - New contracts cannot start with 0xEF byte
/// - Applies to CREATE, CREATE2, and deployment transactions
/// - Existing contracts with 0xEF prefix remain valid
///
/// ## EOF Preparation
/// This reservation enables future introduction of:
/// - Structured contract format with metadata
/// - Separate code and data sections
/// - Static jumps and improved analysis
/// - Versioning for EVM upgrades
///
/// ## Developer Impact
/// Extremely rare in practice as 0xEF was not a valid opcode,
/// making accidental conflicts unlikely.

/// Creates a ChainRules configuration for a specific Ethereum hardfork.
///
/// This factory function generates the appropriate set of protocol rules
/// for any supported hardfork, enabling the EVM to execute transactions
/// according to historical consensus rules.
///
/// ## Parameters
/// - `hardfork`: The target hardfork to configure rules for
///
/// ## Returns
/// A fully configured ChainRules instance with all flags set appropriately
/// for the specified hardfork.
///
/// ## Algorithm
/// The function starts with all features enabled (latest hardfork) and then
/// selectively disables features that weren't available at the specified
/// hardfork. This approach ensures new features are automatically included
/// in the latest configuration.
///
/// ## Example
/// ```zig
/// // Configure EVM for London hardfork rules
/// const london_rules = ChainRules.for_hardfork(.LONDON);
///
/// // Configure EVM for historical execution (e.g., replaying old blocks)
/// const byzantium_rules = ChainRules.for_hardfork(.BYZANTIUM);
/// ```
///
/// ## Hardfork Ordering
/// Each hardfork case disables all features introduced after it,
/// maintaining historical accuracy for transaction replay and testing.
/// Mapping of chain rule fields to the hardfork in which they were introduced.
